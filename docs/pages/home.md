# OCMP Consent Management Platform

OCMP is a recursive acronym for "OCMP Consent Management Platform" and is a free and open source project that provides a transparent way of managing consent.

## Why Use OCMP?

- **Its Open Source**

  OCMP is, and will forever remain, free and open source. That means its code can easily be reviewed by anyone and verify that nothing hidden is going on "behind the scenes".
  Additionally, if you have the programming knowledge and skills, you can modify it as you see fit for your personal project, no questions asked. If its not your project, you can still do it, provided your modifications become open source as well.

- **Transparency**

  OCMP tries to be as transparent as it can. OCMP is not for sale and will never be, as such it will not hide behind "common sales tactics".
  
- **Documentation**
  
  A big part of OCMP is its documentation. OCMP tries to give the most comprehensive instructions it can, so it can be accessible and available to as many people as possible.

- **It can be set up entirely on Google Tag Manager**

  Yes, that's right. OCMP's primary feature is for you to be able to set it up entirely on Google Tag Manager. If you don't want to set it up throught Tag Manager you can, however, Tag manager is still required for handling the consents and firing the appropriate tags. That means that when a user updates their consent and allow for example the analytics consent, it relies on Tag Manager to fire all the tags that need an Analytics consent. Currently there is no support for OCMP to be set up without Tag Manager.
