# OCMP Consent Management Platform

OCMP is a recursive acronym for "OCMP Consent Management Platform" and is a free and open source project that provides a transparent way of managing consent.
This project is mostly aimed towards static sites that are built with static site generators like Jekyll.

## About OCMP

OCMP is built around Google's Tag Manager (GTM) and uses its consent feature that is currently in beta.

It is possible to add OCMP to a site without even touching the site's source code. To achieve that the site must already have GTM's script and have no other scripts that need consent.

Admitedly a new site, specifically one that is statically generated such as jekyll, will benefit more.
