# OCMP Consent Management Platform

OCMP is a recursive acronym for "OCMP Consent Management Platform" and is a free and open source project that provides a transparent way of managing consent.
This project is mostly aimed towards static sites that are built with static site generators like Jekyll.

## About OCMP

OCMP is built around Google's Tag Manager (GTM) and uses its consent feature that is currently in beta.

It is possible to add OCMP to a site without even touching the site's source code. To achieve that the site must already have GTM's script and have no other scripts that need consent.

Admitedly a new site, specifically one that is statically generated with a tool such as jekyll, will benefit more.

OCMP tries its best to stick as closely to the European GDPR and ePrivacy directive as it can. However since this is the work of a single person without a legal background, this project and software comes with no warranty whatsoever.
