// This project uses gulp include
// The syntax to include files is "//=require ./path/file.ext"
// Uncomment one line so the statement becomes like the one in quotes but without the quotes

// This file is mainly used to initialize OCMP for the docs


// //=require ../data/en.js
//=require ../data/el.js
